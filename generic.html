								<h3> The Meridian Teams </h3>
								<h5> Section 1 </h5>
									<p>Through sickness and through health, the Meridian Team has persevered through time and trials to the point in which we have reached now. We've created a massive new piece of gameplay onto the Roblox platform, Expanse; Skirmisher, or as we call it, Skirmisher. Skirmisher is a MOBA, of sorts, which uses the combat mechanics of Expanse, along with its ships. Skirmisher is our avenue to creating the best possible space sim combat, similar to that of Star Citizens "Arena Commander." We use a physics based flight system, high detail ships, multi-crewed vessels so you can team up with your friends in a single ship,and UI based weaponry. All of which is much more than most have accomplished. However, with all this work and effort, it took us nearly 3 years to develop fully.</p>
									<p>One of the major aspects of Skirmisher is of course what you see, and what you see 100% of the time is the UI and HUD. The user interface is your visual tool for ship selection, the menus, and all the little buttons that go with it, while the HUD, or Heads Up Display, is your shield and hull stats, the notification menu on the right, and the crew member specific mechanics, like the engineer's stat wheel. The team behind this work is the art department, led by the one and only DoubleDog_DareMe. DoubleDog is a man of many skills. He creates most of the skins we have available for the ships, he's made the majority of the UI/HUD in Skirmisher and all the conceptual work on Expanse's UI. However, he does not work alone: he has a friend come along with him to design the small, yet important details and that is ZiggiousZaggious. Ziggious has been with us for some time and works on the icons for ships, weaponry, and more.</p>
									<p>Along with UI, another large source of content you see is from the biggest team we have, the build department. The Lead of the build team is AlexiRyaov. Alexi is one of the oldest members in Meridian and proves it everyday. Along with Alexi, he now has 7 other members on his team. The build team have worked relentlessly to construct all the ships, the battle zones, the ship interiors, stations, every tiny detail you see in the areas is all their work. However, within the build team, there's also a sub-team. Their synergy between one another is what forms the aesthetics that is shown everywhere. And so we have the effects team. This department is composed of the audio engineers, musical masterminds, and the overall visual effects that come along with the battle zones, such as the beams or lasers.</p>
									<p>The four smaller teams in the Meridian Studios are all lead by a single member, AlexanderKotevski. Alexander is the big man of the house, the breadwinner, the big guy up high. He leads the marketing, writing, balancing, and gameplay directive teams. The marketing team is responsible for getting our name out there, becoming known and letting people know what we're doing. A Public Relations of sorts. Writing is taking care of our lore. The big story behind it all. Every nook, cranny, and crevice will have a name and story to go with it and it's all up to this team to do it. The balancing team helps calibrate ships stats, turret values, and all the things that tie down gameplay and how we think it should be played. And finally, the Gameplay team. Gameplay is the analysis of the live player interaction: what game modes are being played the most, which ship is the favorite, everything that takes place within our product.
</p>
									<p>The significant and most complex team is the Programming team, lead by the lord himself, Oseday. Oseday has been with the team since the Big Bang. He's been working on Skirmisher for some time and only recently hired a new team member, ZacBytes. Oseday has so many new aspects on the Roblox engine with his physics-based movement, the work behind the UI-based weaponry, intricate code behind AI crew members, aim assist, manual gunner mechanics, and so much more behind the scenes that we can't wrap our head around. To establish a general idea of what this team has done, Oseday has fabricated all the aforementioned. He's also developed a Discord bot for our server, made the statistics gathering through Amazon servers for the balancing and gameplay team, helped create our website, and even made a new particle system to see them from farther distances.</p>
								<h3> Community Feedback </h3>
								<h5> Section 2 </h5>
									<p>Through the 3 years of making Skirmisher, we've had to run tests, get suggestions, find new ways around roadblocks, and get community feedback. And so here we are, showcasing the community! There's no reason for creating content if there's no one to share content with, so we hope you enjoy what we've made here at Meridian Studios. Here's what we've been told by testers and community members about our work.</p>
