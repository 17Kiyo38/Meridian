								<h3> The Meridian Teams </h3>
								<h5> Section 1 </h5>
									<p>Through sickness and health, the Meridian Team has endured the test of time to the point we have reached now. We've created a massive new piece of gameplay in the Roblox platform, Expanse: Skirmisher; or as we call it, Skirmisher. It’s a MOBA of sorts which uses the combat mechanics of Expanse, along with its ships. Skirmisher is our avenue to creating the best possible space sim combat, similar to that of Star Citizen’s "Arena Commander." We use a physics-based flight system, high detail ships, multi-crewed vessels so you can team up with your friends in a single ship, and UI based weaponry, in which is much more than most have accomplished. However, despite all this work and effort, it has taken us nearly 3 years to develop fully.</p>
									<p>One of the major aspects of Skirmisher is of course what you see, and what you see 100% of the time is the UI and HUD. The user interface is your visual tool for ship selection, the menus, and all the little buttons that go with it, while the HUD, or heads up display, is your shield and hull stats, the notification menu on the right, and the crew member specific mechanics, like the engineer's stat wheel. The team behind this work is the art department, led by the one and only DoubleDog_DareMe. DoubleDog is a man of many skills. He creates most of the skins we have available for the ships, he's made the majority of the UI/HUD in Skirmisher and all the conceptual work on Expanse's UI. However, he does not work alone: he has a friend come along with him to design the small, yet important details and that is ZiggiousZaggious. Ziggious has been with us for some time and works on the icons for ships, weaponry, and more.</p>
									<p>Along with UI, another large source of content you see is from the biggest team we have, the build department. The lead of the build team is AlexiRyaov. Alexi is one of the oldest members in Meridian and proves it every day. Along with Alexi, he now has 7 other members on his team. The build team has worked relentlessly to construct all the ships, the battle zones, the ship interiors, stations, every tiny detail you see in the areas is all their work. However, within the build team, there's also a sub-team. Their synergy between one another is what forms the aesthetics that is shown everywhere. And so we have the effects team. This department is composed of the audio engineers, musical masterminds, and the overall visual effects that come along with the battle zones, such as the beams or lasers.</p>
									<p>The four smaller teams in the Meridian Studios are all led by a single member, AlexanderKotevski. Alexander is the big man of the house, the breadwinner, the big guy up high. He leads the marketing, writing, balancing, and gameplay directive teams. The marketing team is responsible for getting our name out there, becoming known and letting people know what we're doing. A Public Relations of sorts. Writing is taking care of our lore. The big story behind it all. Every nook, cranny, and crevice will have a name and story to go with it and it's all up to this team to do it. The balancing team helps calibrate ships stats, turret values, and all the things that tie down gameplay and how we think it should be played. And finally, the gameplay team. Gameplay is the analysis of the live player interaction: what game modes are being played the most, which ship is the favorite, everything that takes place within our product.</p>
									<p>The significant and most complex team is the programming team, led by the lord himself, Oseday. Oseday has been with the team since the Big Bang. He's been working on Skirmisher for some time and only recently hired a new team member, ZacBytes. Oseday has so many new aspects on the Roblox engine with his physics-based movement, the work behind the UI-based weaponry, intricate code for the AI crew members, aim assist, manual gunner mechanics, and so much more behind the scenes work that we can't wrap our head around. To establish a general idea of what this team has done, Oseday has fabricated all the aforementioned. He's also developed a Discord bot for our server, made the statistics gathering through Amazon servers for the balancing and gameplay team, helped create our website, and even made a new particle system to see them from farther distances.</p>
								
								
								<h3> Tester's Thoughts </h3>
								<h5> Section 2 </h5>
									<p>Through the 3 years of making Skirmisher, we've had to run tests, get suggestions, find new ways around roadblocks, and get community feedback. And so here we are, showcasing the community! There's no reason for creating content if there's no one to share content with, so we hope you enjoy what we've made here at Meridian Studios. Here's what we've been told by testers and community members about our work.</p>
								
								<p><em>1wwwdotrobloxdotcom</em><br>
									<strong>Question 1: How do you feel that the game has progressed overall?</strong><br> Answer: In my opinion, Skirmisher has progressed rather quickly and the game today is very different [from] the game I first played in early November [of 2017]. Back then, the only ships were blade ships and some of [Galverino’s] ships and the game lacked most of its UI features, nor did it have modules or customization turrets, from what I remember. Fast forward to today and there is a fancy menu, absolutely stunning graphics (lasers, hull damage, explosions, really nice shadows, and flares) and many more ships. It’s amazing how polished the game feels now. <br><strong>Q2: What could we improve for later updates?</strong><br> A: Although the game feel[s] really polished, I think the gameplay progression is too quick. Back when all the ships had levels I reached the final ship in a matter of weeks. This could be fixed by making ships harder to unlock, maybe a 150% XP increase and adding unlockable modules and turrets. A prestige system at level 100 maybe might also be nice as it would keep the feeling of progression which I find vital in this type of game.</p>
								<p><em>Stelamon5</em><br>
									<strong>Question 1: What's your favorite aspect of Expanse; Skirmisher?</strong><br> Answer: Honestly, my favorite part of the game is the teamwork and coordination required to take down larger capital ships with the bombers/fighters.<br><strong>Q2: What could we improve on for later updates?</strong><br> A2: Probably fine tune the controls; Little hard to maneuver in situations where you have limited room. Especially with the "drift" on the smaller ships.</p>
								<p><em>daycko1</em><br>
									<strong>Question: What’s your favorite aspect of Expanse: Skirmisher?</strong><br>Answer: The graphics. It’s awesome. I never [expected] something this epic looking [on] Roblox.</p>
								<p><em>JamesMdrago</em><br>
									<strong>Question 1: What’s your favorite aspect of Expanse: Skirmisher?</strong><br>Answer: My favorite [aspect has got to] be the dogfighting, especially how you can slip through small cracks. Although I would like it if smaller ships had a larger role against large craft, so that bombers didn't necessarily do the majority of the damage ... rather, they, alongside very skilled fighters, could disable hostile weaponry.<br><strong>Q2: What’s something you’d like to see added in future updates?</strong><br>A: Something I'd like to see, well it sort [of] goes hand-in-hand with [question] 1, subsystems on larger crafts, namely a reactor system for anything larger than a cruiser, fire control for anything larger than a frigate, engines for anything larger than a bomber, and individually destroyable turrets, colossal ships should be very difficult, but not impossible for a small squad to take out, that gives a David and Goliath sense. Currently, if anyone wants to go head to head against one of the larger ships, they're just gonna get demolished, even if they fly in a bomber formation, only equally as large or larger craft pose a threat to them.</p>

									<h3>A Blast from the Past</h3>
									<h5>Section 3</h5>
									<p>Meridian Studios wasn’t always the way it is now. A lot can change over 3 years, and a lot has changed, so we’re going to showcase what has happened to us and just how we worked through it all.</p>
									<p>To start us off, there used to only be a few members on the team, and a majority of them left  never to be seen again. Of these members were Matrix, Raven, and AlexiRyaov. After awhile, they noticed their work wasn’t going so well so they brought in the big guns. AlexanderKotevski. Alexander was there to help keep the team in line and on check with what was needed to be worked on, and this was very much-needed. And out of the Big Bang came the lord Oseday. However, with the new team members coming on board, a few had to be let go, and upon doing so, the development process reboots! With the new team, Alexander had set out to expand on his idea to get the game going and set up a basic outline of what The Great Expanse will accomplish. Alexi worked on updating the ships while Oseday had made the physics-based flight engine. However, as time passed and things went on, there were destined slow downs and setbacks, and there still are. Even with all this new content being worked on, there wasn’t a whole lot to look at, so Alexi got a UI designer, and the team was excited. At this point, Alexander had tried his hand in creating a website for the team, and we’re not going to discuss it much further. This is all during the 2016 American presidential campaigns, and shortly after this, our weapons system was born. Galverino started making ships and the first fighters to join the lineup. Soon after Galv’s ship outburst, Alexi wanted to join in on the fun and started designing his unique blade ships. Around March of 2017, DoubleDog, or rather Sanddog, was added to the team and spaceball was created; the most popular game mode we now have. He then worked on Expanse’s second generation of UI while Alexi was still working on blade ships, and more ship interiors. And thus, shortly there after, the era of ship skins was born and they are a fan favorite. Around time of September 2017, Kiyo was added to the mix of the teams and helps Alexander with his department in taking care of Public Relations. Roughly 5 months later and the we created the Community Discord, DoubleDog is making the 3rd generation UI, the ship count is up to 21, we’ve added modules, turret selection, and 2 battle zones with 4 game modes. We’ve gone through nearly 30 developers on our team and we’re still looking for more to help us create Roblox’s largest data persistent universe sandbox.</p>
